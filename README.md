# Movie-Data-Exploration

This is an exploration of a sample movie dataset obtained during the course of completing the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on Coursera. Howerver this exploration is done independently and not as part of the coursework. This analysis was performed because I thought the dataset had interesting insights to provide. 
The dataset contains information about Movie titles, Release Date, Genre, Directors, Cast, Budget and Box office Revenue for movies between 2012 and 2016. 

Post analysis I created visualizations in Tablueau along with a couple of Dashboards to better illustrate the various trends that emerged from this process. Overall it was quite a fulfilling endeavour.
